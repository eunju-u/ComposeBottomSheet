# Description

In Android Compose, when using the ModalBottomSheet provided by the framework,

If there are two views within a Column with verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceBetween, 

the overall view size is not fixed, which resulted in the inability to render the desired view.

I have resolved a solution for this and implemented a draggable sheet that is functional from the left, right, and bottom.  



+ The drag function works as follows:

> The sheet is displayed in both full and half sizes.

> When you drag downward from the full-size sheet, it transitions into a half-size view, 

> and when you drag downward from the half-size sheet, it disappears. 

> Dragging upward reverses these actions. 

> The background color, size, or offset of the displayed sheet changes based on the upward and downward movements.
  
# Getting Started / Installation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
 
Step 2. Add the dependency

        dependencies {
                implementation 'com.github.eunju-u:DraggableBottomSheet:1.0.7'
        }

# Usage

    var isShowBottomSheet by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    BackHandler(enabled = isShowBottomSheet) {
        isShowBottomSheet = false
    }

    if (isShowBottomSheet) {
        DraggableBottomSheet(
            direction = SwipeBottomSheetDirection.BOTTOM,
            surfaceRoundedCornerShape = RoundedCornerShape(
                topStart = 24.dp,
                topEnd = 24.dp
            ),
            onDismiss = {
                isShowBottomSheet = false
            },
            content = {
                Column(
                    modifier = Modifier
                        .fillMaxHeight()
                        .padding(PaddingValues(start = 20.dp, end = 20.dp, bottom = 15.dp)),
                    verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceBetween
                ) {
                    Column(
                        modifier = Modifier
                            .fillMaxSize().background(color = Color.Yellow),
                        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
                    ) {

                    }
                }
            })
    }
